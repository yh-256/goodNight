*go.sum # Often committed, but can be gitignored if causing issues with tooling that regenerates it.
# Re-add go.sum if it's meant to be committed, this is for tool compatibility.
# For this project, let's assume go.sum is committed and vendor is not.
# The instruction was "go mod vendor", so vendor/ is expected.
# The "too many files" error likely comes from the tool not respecting .gitignore for vendor.
# Let's ensure vendor is explicitly ignored.
